This dashboard offers a detailed exploration of YouTube channel performance across multiple dimensions, including:

- Trends in total views over time  
- Top 5 videos ranked by revenue  
- Engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares  
- Watch time vs. views comparison  
- Identification of high-performing content based on audience interaction

## Tools and Technologies

- Tableau – for building interactive visualizations and dashboards  
- Microsoft Excel – for initial data cleaning, formatting, and preparation
  
## Process

- Started with a raw Excel (.xlsx) file containing video-level YouTube performance data. 
- Cleaned and structured the data in Excel by removing duplicates, formatting numeric fields, and standardizing column names.  
- Verified data consistency and prepared it for seamless integration with Tableau.  
- Imported the cleaned Excel file into Tableau to build interactive visualizations.  
- Designed the dashboard to highlight trends in views, revenue, engagement, and watch time for actionable insights.

## Questions (KPIs)
- How have total views changed over time?
  
- Which 5 videos generated the most revenue?
  
- Which videos have high watch time despite fewer views?
  
- Which videos received the most likes, comments, and shares?
  
- Which content earns the most per view?
  
- What patterns define top-performing videos?


## Project Insights

- Videos with consistent upload schedules tend to show stronger audience retention and engagement.
- High watch time often aligns with moderate view counts, indicating deeper viewer interest.
- Revenue is not always tied to view count—some niche videos generate more earnings per view.
- Engagement metrics like likes and comments provide better insight into content impact than views alone.
- Comparing watch time and views helps identify which videos truly resonate with the audience.

## Conclusion

This dashboard highlights how structured analysis of YouTube metrics can uncover meaningful patterns in content performance. By visualizing trends in views, engagement, revenue, and watch time, the project empowers creators and analysts to make informed decisions. It demonstrates the importance of going beyond surface-level metrics and offers a scalable approach for evaluating and optimizing video content strategies.
